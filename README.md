# 🐾 Animal Image Classifier

This project is part of my internship at **Unified Mentor**. It uses **Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)** to classify animal images into 15 different categories.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Classify images into one of the following animals:
  `Bear`, `Bird`, `Cat`, `Cow`, `Deer`, `Dog`, `Dolphin`, `Elephant`, `Giraffe`, `Horse`, `Kangaroo`, `Lion`, `Panda`, `Tiger`, `Zebra`

- **Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, MobileNetV2, PyCharm

## 🧠 What I Did

- Used ImageDataGenerator for preprocessing and augmentation
- Applied Transfer Learning using MobileNetV2
- Trained model for 10 epochs
- Achieved validation accuracy around 85–90%
- Saved the trained model as `.h5` file
- Created a PDF report with all steps and results
